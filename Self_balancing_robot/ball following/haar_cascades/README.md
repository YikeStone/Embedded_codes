These are haar cascades of Tennis Ball trained using OpenCV haar training module.

The cascades were trained on images captured by Pi Camera.

It took more than 72 hours to train cascade4 alone on i7 4720 HQ, 8GB RAM and GTX 950M GPU.

The OpenCV implementation of haar training module is not GPU intensive, it works only on CPU.
